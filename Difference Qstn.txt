method will adjust the existed element to next index value. If no element is existed at the specified index then add() method add the specified element 
at the specified index.

If any element is existed at the specified index then set() method will remove the existed element and set(-) method will 
add the specified element to the specified index and set() method will return the removed element.
If no element is existed at the specified index value then set() method will rise an exception like java.lang.indexOutOfBoundsException.
