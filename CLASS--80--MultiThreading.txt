Threads Design in Java:
There are two approaches to create threads in java applications.
a)Extending Thread class
b)Implementing Runnable interface
a)Extending Thread class
1)Declare an user defined class.
2)Extend java.lang.Thread class to user defined class
3)Override Thread class run() method in user defined thread class with the implementation repersenting a particular task which we want to perfrom by creating a thread.
4)In main class, in main() method, create object for user defined class

package com.durgasoft.core;

class MyThread extends Thread{
	public void run() {
		for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
			System.out.println("User Thread   :"+i);
		}
	}
}
public class Test {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		MyThread mt=new MyThread();
		mt.start();
	}

}

User Thread   :0
User Thread   :1
User Thread   :2
User Thread   :3
User Thread   :4
User Thread   :5
User Thread   :6
User Thread   :7
User Thread   :8
User Thread   :9

package com.durgasoft.core;

class MyThread extends Thread{
	public void run() {
		for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
			System.out.println("User Thread    :"+i);
		}
	}
}
public class Test {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		MyThread mt=new MyThread();
		mt.start();
		for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
			System.out.println("Main Thread    :"+i);
		}
	}

}
